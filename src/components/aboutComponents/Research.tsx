    In the formed new committee, a new post was introduced as Research and
Development. This was led by Nishan Khanal. The R&D Unit initiated the work of
research in our community. The first notable work of this unit includes a collaboration
with Racheal Lau regarding a talk on research.<br></br><br></br>
Under the supervision of Asst. Professor Er. Dinesh Banyia Khastri, R&D Unit applied
for the research grant proposed by NCE College. For this research, the R&D Unit of
ECAST collaborated with the Central Department of Physics, TU for resources. The
topic of the research is <b> “Deep Generative Modeling for Automated Image
Manipulation by Interpreting Text-Guided Prompts with Natural Language
Instructions”</b>. This research aims to develop a new algorithm in the field of image
processing using a diffusion model. The research on completion will develop an
algorithm for undoing and redoing edited images.<br></br><br></br>
Further, the R&D Unit is seeking collaboration with the foreign university regarding
research programs.
